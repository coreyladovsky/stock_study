# Stock Study

Welcome and thanks for reading about [Stock Study](https://coreyladovsky.com/stock_study)!

### The Concept:
I have selected 5 of the cheapest most volatile stocks money can buy. Stock Study is an application that tracks those five stocks over the time period of the last seven days. The line graph shows the closing price of all five stocks. If you click on a stock you can gain more insight into how that stock performed during the day.

### The Technologies:

This app is a JavaScript app that utilized the d3 library.
I am also working with HTML5 as well as CSS3 for styling purposes.

To gather the stock information I am pinging the Alpha Vantage API. Here is there [Website](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/).

### The Future
I would like to change my app to reflect the stocks percentage changes instead of their price change. This would allow me to show a greater variety of stocks without ruining the y-axis.

I would like to add an input space for users to add their own stock picks to the graph.

I would like to have the option of showing different lengths of time periods.
